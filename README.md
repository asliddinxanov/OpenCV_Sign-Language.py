# Creating a Hand Tracking Module using Python and OpenCv

Hand tracking is the process in which a computer uses computer vision to detect a hand from an input image and keeps focus on the handâ€™s movement and orientation. Hand tracking allows us to develop numerous programs that use hand movement and orientation as their input.

We tend to write the same code in different projects to perform hand tracking as part of our program. Creating a hand tracking module solves this problem since we write the code once.

We then convert this piece of code into a module. We can import this module into any python project that we are working on and it will perform hand tracking.
