Hand tracking is the process in which a computer uses computer vision to detect a hand from an input image and keeps focus on the handâ€™s movement and orientation. Hand tracking allows us to develop numerous programs that use hand movement and orientation as their input.

We tend to write the same code in different projects to perform hand tracking as part of our program. Creating a hand tracking module solves this problem since we write the code once.

We then convert this piece of code into a module. We can import this module into any python project that we are working on and it will perform hand tracking.

## Introduction

To create the program that will perform hand tracking, we will need two Python libraries. These are openCV.

We will use openCV to perform operations associated with computer vision. We will use MediaPipe to perform the actual hand detection and tracking on our input image. We will finally need an IDE. For this tutorial, we will use the Pycharm IDE.

This tutorial will be divided into two parts. The first part will focus on how to create a program that does hand tacking. The second part will focus on how to turn the program into a module. A person using Windows, Linux, or macOS can follow through.
